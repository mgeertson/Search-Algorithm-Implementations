Assignment 1: Alternating disks problem, left-to-right algorithm

Given 2n alternating disks (dark, dark, light, light)the program reads the number of single color disks (light or dark), arranges the disks in the correct order and outputs the number of swaps

INPUT: an even positive integer n and a list of 2n disks of alternating colors dark-dark-light-light, starting with dark

OUTPUT: a list of 2n disks, the first n disks are light and the next n disks are dark, and an integer m representing the number of moves necessary to move the dark ones before the light ones




Assignment 1: Alternating disks problem, lawnmower algorithm

Given 2n alternating disks (dark, dark, light, light) the program reads the number of single color disks (light or dark), arranges the disks in the correct order and outputs the number of swaps

INPUT: an even positive integer n and a list of 2n disks of alternating colors dark-dark-light-light, starting with dark

OUTPUT: a list of 2n disks, the first n disks are light, the next n disks are dark, and an integer m representing the number of moves necessary to move the dark ones before the light ones

Assignment 2: Longest non-decreasing subsequence problem, end-to-beginning algorithm   

Given a sequence of elements the program finds a subsequence of it in which the subsequence's elements are in sorted order, lowest to highest, and in which the subsequence is as long as possible. The program reads the number of elements in the sequence, then the elements and outputs the sorted sequence and the running time.

INPUT: a positive integer n and a list of n elements  

OUTPUT: a longest non-decreasing subsequence of the initial sequence

Assignment 3: Euclidean traveling salesperson problem: exhaustive optimization algorithm

A special case of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the input is a Euclidean graph

INPUT: a positive integer n and a list P of n distinct points representing vertices of a Euclidean graph

OUTPUT: a list of n points from P representing a Hamiltonian cycle of minimum total weight for the graph.


Assignment 3: Euclidean traveling salesperson problem: improved nearest neighbor algorithm

A special case of the classical traveling salesman problem (TSP) where the input is a Euclidean graph

INPUT: a positive integer n and a list P of n distinct points representing vertices of a Euclidean graph

OUTPUT: a list of n points from P representing a Hamiltonian cycle of relatively minimum total weight for the graph.


Assignment 4: Cuckoo Hashing algorithm

An open addressing method called Cuckoo Hashing

INPUT: an input file containing strings of characters, one string per line

OUTPUT: a detailed list of where the strings are inserted.
